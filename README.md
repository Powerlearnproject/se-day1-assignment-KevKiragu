#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. It combines computer science, mathematics, and project management to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions that meet user needs.
Helps to drive Innovation whilst ensuring there is reliability in terms of the software developed and put on the market/for people to use, as well as ensuring that the software and applications are scalable enough to handle target demographics.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
A. The introduction of structured programming made coding more organized, more efficient, and easier to maintain, which was around the 1970s.
B. The agile manifesto pioneered the rise of agile methodology in software engineering, which shifted focus to actual development.This was able to accelerate software development whilst enabling adaptability.
C.The 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference - It was during this time that the term software engineering was coined to tackle the then software crisis where most software-based projects would fail due to complexities.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis: Gather and document user needs and system requirements.
Design: Create blueprints (e.g., architecture, UI) for the software based on requirements.
Implementation (Coding): Write the actual code to build the software.
Testing: Verify the software works as intended and is free of defects.
Deployment: Release the software to users or production environments.
Maintenance: Update and fix the software post-deployment to ensure ongoing functionality.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is described as A linear, sequential approach where each phase (e.g., design, coding) completes before the next begins.
Pros: Clear structure, predictable timelines, well-suited for fixed requirements.
Cons: Inflexible to changes; late testing can reveal major issues.
Scenario: Developing software for a regulated industry (e.g., medical devices) with stable requirements and compliance is critical.
Agile An iterative, flexible approach with short cycles (sprints) and continuous feedback.
Pros: Adapts to change, delivers working software quickly, emphasizes collaboration.
Cons: Requires strong team communication and less predictable timelines.
Scenario: Building a startup’s mobile app where features evolve based on user feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software Developer:
Roles: Writes, tests, and maintains code based on design specifications.
Responsibilities: Implements features, debugs issues, and collaborates with designers and testers.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Roles: Ensures software meets quality standards before release.
Responsibilities: Designs and executes test cases, reports bugs, and verifies fixes to ensure functionality and performance.
Project Manager:
Roles: Oversees the project’s timeline, budget, and team coordination.
Responsibilities: Defines scope, assigns tasks, manages risks, and ensures delivery aligns with stakeholder expectations.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Importance: IDEs provide a unified platform with tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers, boosting productivity and reducing errors.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS):
Importance: VCS tracks changes to code, enables collaboration, and allows rollback to previous versions, ensuring team coordination and code integrity.
Examples: Git (with platforms like GitHub), Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenge 1: Changing Requirements
Strategy: Use Agile methodologies to iterate and adapt, and maintain clear communication with stakeholders.
Challenge 2: Debugging Complex Issues
Strategy: Employ systematic debugging tools (e.g., breakpoints in IDEs) and write unit tests to isolate problems.
Challenge 3: Time Pressure
Strategy: Prioritize tasks, break work into manageable sprints, and use project management tools like Jira.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components (e.g., functions) in isolation. Importance: Ensures each part works correctly before integration.
Integration Testing: Tests how components work together. Importance: Identifies issues in interactions between modules.
System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole. Importance: Validates end-to-end functionality and performance.
Acceptance Testing: Tests if the software meets user requirements. Importance: Confirms the product is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input queries (prompts) to elicit accurate, relevant, and useful responses from AI models, such as large language models.
improves Output Quality: Well-crafted prompts reduce ambiguity, ensuring the AI understands the task.
Maximizes Efficiency: Specific prompts save time by minimizing trial-and-error interactions.
Unlocks AI Potential: It enables users to effectively leverage AI for complex tasks (e.g., coding, analysis) by framing requests.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about software."
Issues: Lacks focus—software could mean engineering, types, history, etc. The AI might give a broad, unhelpful response.
Improved Prompt: "Explain the role of software engineering in developing secure web applications."
Why It’s More Effective: It specifies the topic (software engineering), context (web applications), and goal (security focus), guiding the AI to provide a targeted, relevant answer.
